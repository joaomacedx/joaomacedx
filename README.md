  <h2> About me </h2>
  <p>As a Software Engineer in training, my main focus is on Back-End development and Software Architecture. I am highly committed and proactive, always striving to apply good development practices, testing, refactoring, and application maintenance. As a Software Engineering intern, I work to produce clean, secure, and optimized code. I also utilize Agile methodologies to increase productivity in the development cycle, using the Scrum framework.

In addition, I serve as a Volunteer Researcher at the Microcontroller Architecture and Virtual Reality/Augmented Reality Technology Laboratory at the University. Currently, I am developing skills in Software Architecture, Design Patterns, and Test Driven Development.

I am always seeking challenges and opportunities to grow as a Software Engineer and contribute to the success of the projects I work on.

Outside of work, I love programming solutions that enhance my quality of life and proactivity. I enjoy traveling, listening to music, playing the guitar and trumpet. I am passionate about literature because it allows me to learn new concepts. Additionally, I enjoy contemplating philosophical and metaphysical questions. I study the financial market to understand the global economic landscape, ensuring a minimum level of security for my investments. Furthermore, I am passionate about gastronomy.</p>
